# vercel-minimum-reproducible
Here is an example to reproduce the error. Here I created 128 exports.

The problem is that in my project I already have more than 128 exports because I really like to modularize my code and also my api is becoming a bit big.
Here I attach an image of the error. It only happen with vercel dev command
